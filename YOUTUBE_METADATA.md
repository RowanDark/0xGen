```markdown
**Title:** [Release] 0xGen Alpha – Open-source security testing with AI scanning and SLSA L3 provenance

**Body:**

I've been building an open-source security testing platform and just released the alpha. The goal is to provide a free alternative to tools like Burp Suite with modern features like AI-assisted vulnerability analysis and cryptographically verifiable builds.

**Features:**
- HTTP proxy with TLS interception (similar to Burp Proxy)
- AI-powered vulnerability detection via plugin system
- Request/response modification and replay
- Desktop GUI (Tauri + React) and CLI
- SLSA Level 3 build provenance for supply chain security
- Sandboxed plugins with capability-based security model

**Technical Details:**
- Backend: Go with gRPC for plugin communication
- Frontend: Tauri (Rust) with React + TypeScript
- Plugin SDK: Go-based with strict sandboxing (chroot on Unix, temp dirs on Windows)
- Build system: GitHub Actions with provenance attestations
- License: Apache 2.0

**Demo Video:** [YouTube link]
**Repository:** [GitHub link]
**Docs:** [Docs link]

The alpha is functional but rough around the edges. I'm actively developing and open to contributions. Feedback welcome!

**Roadmap highlights:**
- Fuzzing engine (Blitz plugin)
- WebSocket interception
- Scripting API for custom workflows
- Intruder/Blitz-style payload processing

Let me know if you have questions about the architecture or features!
```

**Posting Tips:**
- **Read subreddit rules carefully** (some ban self-promotion)
- **Engage with comments** promptly and professionally
- **Cross-post judiciously** (avoid spamming across too many subreddits at once)
- **Timing:** Post during peak hours (9am-11am, 7pm-9pm ET)

### Hacker News

**Submission (Week 2, not Week 1):**

**Title:**
```
Show HN: 0xGen – Open-source security testing platform with AI scanning
```

**Link:** [YouTube video URL]

**First Comment (as submitter, providing context):**
```
Creator here. I built 0xGen to address some gaps I've experienced with existing security testing tools.

**Why this exists:**
- Free alternative to Burp Suite (Apache 2.0 licensed)
- AI-powered vulnerability analysis (uses LLMs for explaining findings)
- Modern desktop GUI built with Tauri (not Electron, not Java)
- SLSA Level 3 provenance for every build (supply chain security)

**Tech stack:**
- Backend: Go, gRPC for plugin communication
- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Tauri shell, not web-based)
- Plugins: Sandboxed with capability controls (tokens with 1-min TTL)

**What works now:**
- HTTP proxy with TLS interception
- Flow capture and replay
- Basic vulnerability scanning via Hydra plugin
- Plugin marketplace with signature verification

**What's coming:**
- Fuzzing engine (Blitz)
- WebSocket support
- Advanced request diffing
- Macro recording/playback

The alpha has some rough edges but core workflows are functional. I'm building in public and happy to answer questions about design decisions, trade-offs, or implementation details.

Interested in feedback, especially around the plugin security model and UI/UX.
```

**HN Best Practices:**
- **Be honest about limitations** – HN users appreciate transparency
- **Respond to technical questions** quickly and thoroughly
- **Avoid marketing language** – focus on technical merit
- **Engage with criticism** constructively
- **Don't vote manipulate** – let it rise organically
