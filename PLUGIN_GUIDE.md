# Plugin Security Guide

This guide summarizes the expectations for Glyph plugins and provides practical
patterns to keep new integrations safe.

## Design principles

* **Use the broker APIs** for outbound HTTP, credential access, and artifact
  exchange. They add auditing, authorization, and uniform logging.
* **Avoid raw filesystem access**. Plugins should only write to their allocated
  workspace and must not read arbitrary host paths or environment variables that
  are unrelated to their task.
* **Do not assume unrestricted networking.** Outbound connections may be
  filtered or proxied. Use declarative manifest capabilities for any required
  egress and prefer broker helpers for HTTP/WebSocket traffic.
* **Fail closed.** Handle broker errors, timeouts, and validation failures by
  terminating gracefully rather than retrying indefinitely.
* **Keep dependencies minimal and pinned.** Rely on reproducible builds, lock
  files, and integrity verification to reduce supply-chain exposure.

## Recommended development workflow

1. Start from the minimal plugin skeleton below.
2. Declare capabilities explicitly in `manifest.json`.
3. Use the SDK helpers for broker communication and structured logging.
4. Cover both success and failure scenarios in integration tests.
5. Run `make lint` and `make test` (or the plugin's equivalent scripts) before
   sending a PR.

## Example manifest

```json
{
  "$schema": "../manifest.schema.json",
  "name": "glyph-example-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Demonstrates a minimal, sandbox-friendly plugin",
  "entry": "./cmd/start.sh",
  "capabilities": {
    "http": { "outbound": ["broker"] },
    "storage": { "workspace": true },
    "secrets": { "broker": true }
  },
  "sandbox": {
    "user": "glyph",
    "mounts": ["workspace"],
    "network": "isolated"
  }
}
```

## Minimal secure skeleton

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Use broker-provided workspace paths
WORKDIR="${GLYPH_WORKSPACE:?missing workspace}"
LOG_PATH="$WORKDIR/run.log"

log() {
  printf '%s\t%s\n' "$(date -Is)" "$*" | tee -a "$LOG_PATH"
}

log "starting example plugin"

# Fetch tasks via the SDK rather than raw curl
if ! glyphctl broker task pull --out "$WORKDIR/task.json"; then
  log "failed to retrieve task"; exit 1
fi

# Process data and emit findings
python3 plugin/main.py "$WORKDIR/task.json"
```

The script uses broker commands instead of reading environment variables or
making unaudited network calls. Any additional tooling should live inside the
sandbox and avoid `sudo`, host mounts, or direct Docker API access.

## Testing checklist

* Run unit tests with mocked broker responses.
* Execute integration tests in the same container image used in production.
* Validate manifests with `npm -s i -g ajv-cli@5.0.0 && ajv validate -s plugins/manifest.schema.json -d plugins/<your-plugin>/manifest.json`.
* Inspect logs for unexpected environment variables, network destinations, or
  filesystem paths.
* Confirm that findings redact secrets and personally identifiable information.
