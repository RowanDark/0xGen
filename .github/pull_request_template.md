## Security impact
<!-- Describe auth, crypto, injection, secrets, data flows, and how you mitigated risk. If there is no security impact, explain why. -->

## Security checklist
- [ ] I reviewed the [security policy](../SECURITY.md) and [threat model](../THREAT_MODEL.md) for impacts.
- [ ] (Plugins only) I followed the [plugin security guide](../PLUGIN_GUIDE.md) and documented any deviations.

## Tests
<!-- List automated checks and manual validation performed (e.g. `go test ./...`). -->

## Rollback plan
<!-- Outline how to revert safely if needed, including follow-up cleanup. -->
