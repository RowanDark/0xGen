# {{.PluginName}}

This plugin was generated by `glyph-plugin init --lang go`.

## Development

```bash
make lint
make test
```

The lint step forbids direct filesystem or networking calls. Use the
`pluginsdk.UseFilesystem`, `pluginsdk.UseNetwork`, and `pluginsdk.UseSecrets`
helpers to request broker-mediated access.
