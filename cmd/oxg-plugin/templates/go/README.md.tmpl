# {{.PluginName}}

This plugin was generated by `oxg-plugin init --lang go`.

## Development

```bash
make lint
make test
```

The lint step forbids direct filesystem or networking calls. Use the
`pluginsdk.UseFilesystem`, `pluginsdk.UseNetwork`, and `pluginsdk.UseSecrets`
helpers to request broker-mediated access. Toggle the capabilities exposed in
`internal/plugin/capabilities.go` to keep the manifest, runtime config, and
tests aligned.
