### Launch Announcement (Professional)

```
🚀 Introducing 0xGen: Open Source Security Testing Platform

After comprehensive development and auditing, I'm excited to announce 0xGen v2.0.0-alpha—a free, open-source alternative to commercial security testing tools like Burp Suite Professional.

Why This Matters:

✅ Full HTTP/HTTPS proxy with MITM interception
✅ Active scanning for SQLi, XSS, SSRF, and more
✅ SLSA Level 3 supply chain security (top 1% of OSS)
✅ 5-layer plugin security model
✅ Modern cross-platform desktop GUI
✅ Docker/Kubernetes native

Current Status:
• 89% feature parity with Burp Suite Professional
• Phase 2 complete (comprehensive audit verification)
• Alpha release for early adopters
• Beta planned for Q1 2025

Technical Differentiators:
• SLSA Level 3 attestation (cryptographic build provenance)
• Plugin sandboxing with 5 security layers
• Cloud-native architecture (stateless, observable)
• API-first design (gRPC + REST)
• MIT licensed (truly open source)

This isn't just another security tool—it's a commitment to democratizing professional security testing.

Perfect For:
• Bug bounty hunters
• Penetration testers
• Development teams
• Security researchers
• Educational institutions

Get Started:
• GitHub: github.com/RowanDark/0xGen
• Documentation: [link]
• Installation: brew install rowandark/0xgen/0xgen

I'd love your feedback, especially from security professionals. What features matter most to you?

## Crisis Communication Plan

### Negative Feedback Response

**If someone says "This is worse than Burp"**:
```
Thanks for trying 0xGen! 🙏

You're right that we're not at 100% parity yet (currently 89%). We're transparent about being in alpha.

What specific features are you missing? That helps us prioritize the roadmap.

For production use, Burp is definitely more mature. 0xGen is for early adopters comfortable with rough edges.

Appreciate the honest feedback—it makes us better!
