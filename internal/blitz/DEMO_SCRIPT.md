---

## Script Outline

### Scene 1: Introduction (0:00 - 0:30)

**[Visual: Split screen showing Burp Suite logo vs 0xGen Blitz logo]**

**Narrator:**
"Welcome to Blitz - the AI-powered web fuzzer that takes everything you love about Burp Suite Intruder and supercharges it with artificial intelligence. In the next 5 minutes, I'll show you why Blitz is the future of web application security testing."

**[Visual: Text overlay - "4 Attack Types | AI Payloads | Smart Detection | Open Source"]**

---

### Scene 2: Side-by-Side Setup (0:30 - 1:30)

**[Visual: Split screen - Burp Intruder on left, Blitz GUI on right]**

**Narrator:**
"Let's test a vulnerable login form for SQL injection. I'll set up the same attack in both tools."

**[Burp Suite side]**
- Shows captured POST request to `/api/login`
- Highlights username and password fields with § markers
- Loads SQLi wordlist (50 payloads)
- Selects "Cluster Bomb" attack type
- Configures threading to 5

**[Blitz GUI side]**
- Shows the same POST request
- Highlights username and password with {{}} markers
- Enables "--ai-payloads" flag
- Selects "Cluster Bomb" attack type
- Sets concurrency to 5

**Narrator:**
"Notice how similar the setup is - Blitz uses the same attack types you're familiar with: Sniper, Battering Ram, Pitchfork, and Cluster Bomb. But watch what happens when we enable AI."

---

### Scene 3: AI Payload Generation (1:30 - 2:15)

**[Visual: Close-up of Blitz analyzing the request]**

**Narrator:**
"Here's where Blitz gets interesting. Instead of manually selecting payloads, Blitz's AI analyzes your request template."

**[Visual: Animation showing AI analysis]**
```
Analyzing request...
✓ Detected POST method
✓ Detected JSON content type
✓ Parameter 'username' → Database context inferred
✓ Parameter 'password' → Authentication context inferred
✓ Selected vulnerability categories: SQLi, Auth Bypass
✓ Generated 45 context-aware payloads
```

**Narrator:**
"The AI identified that we're testing a login endpoint with JSON body, and automatically generated 45 SQL injection payloads relevant to authentication bypass. In Burp, you had to manually curate this wordlist."

**[Visual: Comparison of payload lists]**

**Burp Wordlist (manual):**
```
' OR '1'='1
admin' --
' OR 1=1--
```

**Blitz AI Payloads:**
```
' OR '1'='1
admin' --
' OR 1=1--
{"username":"admin","password":"' OR '1'='1"}  ← JSON-aware
admin')} OR 1=1--  ← Context-aware escaping
' UNION SELECT NULL,user(),database()--  ← Database enumeration
```

**Narrator:**
"See the difference? Blitz generates payloads that understand the JSON context, including proper escaping and structure."

---

### Scene 4: Running the Attack (2:15 - 3:00)

**[Visual: Both tools running simultaneously]**

**Narrator:**
"Let's run both attacks and see what we find."

**[Burp Suite side]**
- Progress bar: 250/2500 requests (10%)
- Table showing results: Status 401, 401, 401, 401...
- No color coding
- User must manually sort and analyze

**[Blitz side]**
- Progress indicator with RPS, ETA, and anomaly counter
- Results table with color-coded status badges
- Real-time classification labels appearing
- Anomaly highlighting in red

**[Visual: Blitz detects anomaly]**

```
[+] Anomaly detected!
    Payload: ' OR '1'='1
    Status: 200 (was 401)
    Length: 523 bytes (+478 from baseline)

[!] AI Classification: auth_bypass
    Confidence: 0.95
    CWE: CWE-287
    OWASP: A07:2021-Authentication Failures

[✓] Finding created: finding-auth-001
```

**Narrator:**
"Within seconds, Blitz detected an authentication bypass and automatically classified it. In Burp, you'd have to manually review hundreds of responses to find this."

---

### Scene 5: AI Classification (3:00 - 3:45)

**[Visual: Close-up of Blitz's AI classifier in action]**

**Narrator:**
"But Blitz doesn't stop at detecting anomalies. Watch as it analyzes each response for vulnerability indicators."

**[Visual: Animation of AI classification]**

**Response 1:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
{"error":"You have an error in your SQL syntax..."}
```
**Classification:** `sql_error` | Confidence: 0.95 | CWE-89

**Response 2:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"success":true,"user":{"id":1,"username":"admin","role":"admin"}}
```
**Classification:** `auth_bypass` | Confidence: 0.85 | CWE-287

**Response 3:**
```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
{"error":"Invalid credentials"}
```
**Classification:** `none` | Not interesting

**Narrator:**
"Blitz's AI uses 50+ detection patterns to classify responses into vulnerability categories - SQL errors, XSS reflection, command execution, sensitive data exposure, and more. Each finding includes CWE and OWASP mappings."

---

### Scene 6: Findings Integration (3:45 - 4:30)

**[Visual: Blitz findings dashboard]**

**Narrator:**
"Here's the real magic: Blitz automatically converts interesting results into actionable security findings."

**[Visual: Finding detail view]**

```json
Finding: SQL Injection in Login Form
----------------------------------------
Severity: High
CWE: CWE-89 (SQL Injection)
OWASP: A03:2021-Injection

Vulnerability Details:
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in the
username parameter, allowing authentication bypass.

Proof of Concept:
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
{"username":"' OR '1'='1","password":"anything"}

Evidence:
- Response status changed from 401 to 200
- Admin account accessed without valid credentials
- Token returned: eyJhbGci...

Remediation:
Use parameterized queries or prepared statements.
Validate and sanitize all user inputs.

References:
- https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection
- https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html
```

**Narrator:**
"Each finding includes severity ratings, exploitation details, proof-of-concept requests, and remediation guidance. This is report-ready output that would take hours to compile manually in Burp."

**[Visual: Split comparison]**

**Burp Suite Workflow:**
1. Run Intruder ✓
2. Sort by status code ✓
3. Manually review responses ✗ (tedious)
4. Identify vulnerabilities ✗ (manual)
5. Take notes ✗ (manual)

## Demo Environment Setup

### Vulnerable Test Application

Use DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) or create a simple test app:

**Simple Vulnerable Login (Node.js/Express):**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  // Intentionally vulnerable SQL query for demo
  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='${username}' AND password='${password}'`;

  // Simulate vulnerable behavior
  if (username.includes("' OR '")) {
    // SQLi successful
    res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Login successful",
      user: { id: 1, username: "admin", role: "administrator" },
      token: "demo-token-123"
    });
  } else if (username === "admin" && password === "admin123") {
    // Valid credentials
    res.status(200).json({
      success: true,
      message: "Login successful",
      user: { id: 1, username: "admin", role: "administrator" },
      token: "demo-token-123"
    });
  } else if (username.includes("admin'")) {
    // SQL error
    res.status(500).json({
      error: "Database error: You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ''admin'' AND password='...' at line 1"
    });
  } else {
    // Invalid credentials
    res.status(401).json({
      error: "Invalid credentials"
    });
  }
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Vulnerable app running on port 3000'));
```

This ensures consistent, demonstrable vulnerability for the video.
