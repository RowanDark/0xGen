# Seer

Seer inspects passive telemetry to spot anomalies and suspicious behaviors before they escalate into incidents. The v0.1 release focuses on low-noise secret and PII detection tailored for HTTP response bodies.

## Capabilities
- `CAP_HTTP_PASSIVE`
- `CAP_EMIT_FINDINGS`

## Detection coverage
The detector library in [`internal/seer`](../../internal/seer) powers the plugin. It combines tuned regular expressions with Shannon entropy heuristics and emits structured findings when it observes:

- AWS access key identifiers (e.g. `AKIA...`).
- Slack tokens (`xoxb-`, `xoxp-`, `xoxa-`, `xoxr-`, `xoxs-`).
- High-entropy generic API keys surfaced through common `api_key=`, `token=`, or `secret=` patterns.
- Email addresses to aid triage. Evidence is redacted to the first and last character of the local-part (for example `alerts@example.com` is reported as `a****s@example.com`).

Evidence for tokens is redacted to only retain the last four characters (e.g. `AKIAABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP` becomes `****************MNOP`). This keeps operator tooling actionable without leaking the full secret.

## Configuration
The binary accepts the following flags (defaults can also be provided through environment variables):

| Flag | Environment | Description |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `--server` | `GLYPH_SERVER` | glyphd gRPC address (defaults to `127.0.0.1:50051`). |
| `--token` | `GLYPH_AUTH_TOKEN` | Authentication token for glyphd (defaults to `supersecrettoken`). |
| `--allowlist` | `SEER_ALLOWLIST_FILE` | Optional path to a newline-separated allowlist file. Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments. |

In addition, `SEER_ALLOWLIST` can supply a comma-separated list of allowlisted tokens or email addresses. All allowlist sources are merged, deduplicated case-insensitively, and applied before any findings are emitted.

## Safety
Fixtures and documentation only contain fake credential shapes. Do not record genuine secrets in tests or repositoriesâ€”always use synthetic values when exercising the detectors.
