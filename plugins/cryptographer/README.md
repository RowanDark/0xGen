# Cryptographer

Cryptographer is a CyberChef-inspired utility surface for quickly transforming payloads and experimenting with encoding operations during investigations.

## Capabilities
- `CAP_REPORT`

## Getting started
Open `ui/index.html` in a browser to explore the placeholder interface. Future tasks can wire the UI into Glyph storage and findings workflows. Consult the [CyberChef documentation](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for guidance on implementing operations. `tests/sample_fixture.json` can house representative transformation recipes as they are designed.
