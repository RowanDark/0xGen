# Grapher

Grapher models assets, relationships, and signals as a connected graph so Glyph workflows can reason about complex environments.

## Capabilities
- `CAP_STORAGE`
- `CAP_EMIT_FINDINGS`

## Getting started
Implement graph construction logic in `plugin.js` and persist data to your preferred backend. Supplement `tests/sample_fixture.json` with miniature graph snapshots to exercise processing code as it matures.
