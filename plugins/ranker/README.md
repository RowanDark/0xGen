# Ranker

Ranker scores assets, findings, and leads so teams focus on the highest-impact work first.

## Capabilities
- `CAP_STORAGE`
- `CAP_EMIT_FINDINGS`

## Getting started
Wire prioritization logic into `plugin.js` and persist intermediate scoring data as needed. Capture realistic ranking inputs in `tests/sample_fixture.json` to support repeatable evaluations.
