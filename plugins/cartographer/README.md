# Cartographer

Cartographer charts application surfaces discovered by crawlers and passive sensors so other plugins can prioritize exploration.

## Capabilities
- `CAP_SPIDER`
- `CAP_EMIT_FINDINGS`

## Getting started
Extend `plugin.js` with crawling orchestration that records discovered assets. Use `tests/sample_fixture.json` to capture representative discovery payloads as they become available.
