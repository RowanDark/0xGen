# Welcome to 0xgen

0xgen is an automation toolkit for orchestrating red-team and detection workflows. It
coordinates plugins such as Galdr, Excavator, Seer, Ranker, and Scribe to turn raw
telemetry into ranked findings and human-readable reports. This site consolidates the
operational and contributor documentation that previously lived in scattered Markdown
files.


Use the navigation sidebar to explore:

- **Quickstart** – run the five-minute demo pipeline and inspect the generated
  artifacts.
- **Plugins** – understand the plugin runtime model and build new detectors with the
  SDK.
- **CLI** – drive 0xgen from the `0xgenctl` command-line interface and tailor the
  runtime configuration.
- **Developer Guide** – set up a development environment, run the test suite, and ship
  changes confidently.
- **Security** – review 0xgen's threat model, provenance guarantees, and vulnerability
  reporting process.

If you are just getting started, the [Quickstart](quickstart.md#getting-started) walkthrough is the best
place to see the platform in action before diving deeper into configuration or plugin
development.
